    <section id="what-programming-languages">
        <h2>What Programming Languages Are & Why They Matter</h2>
        <p>Programming languages are tools that developers use to communicate with computers and build software. They allow us to create applications, websites, games, and much more.</p>
        <p>Each programming language shares certain fundamental elements that make coding possible, such as:</p>
        <div class="multi-column">
          <div>
            <strong>Variables:</strong> Containers for storing data values.
            <em>Analogy: Think of variables as labeled jars in a pantry that store different ingredients like sugar, salt, or flour.</em>
          </div>
          <div>
            <strong>Data Types:</strong> Define the type of data a variable can hold.
            <em>Analogy: Data types are like the labels on jars that specify what kind of ingredient (e.g., spices, grains, or liquids) the jar can hold.</em>
          </div>
          <div>
            <strong>Control Structures:</strong> Enable decision-making and loops.
            <em>Analogy: Control structures are like road signs that tell you when to stop, turn, or loop back while following a route.</em>
          </div>
          <div>
            <strong>Functions:</strong> Encapsulate reusable blocks of code.
            <em>Analogy: Functions are like recipes in a cookbook; once written, you can reuse them to prepare a dish without rewriting the steps.</em>
          </div>
          <div>
            <strong>Syntax:</strong> Rules defining how code should be written and interpreted.
            <em>Analogy: Syntax is like grammar in a language; it ensures that your sentences (code) are structured correctly to convey meaning.</em>

    <section id="why-these-languages">
      <h2>Why These Programming Languages</h2>
      <p>
        At LangLink, we have selected programming languages based on the 
        <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new tab">TIOBE Index</a>, 
        a reliable measure of language popularity.
      </p>
      
      <p>The ratings on the TIOBE Index are determined by various factors, including:</p>
      <ul class="list-1">
        <li><span>The number of skilled engineers worldwide.</span></li>
        <li><span>The availability of courses and third-party vendors.</span></li>
        <li><span>Data collected from popular websites such as Google, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing, and more than 20 others.</span></li>
      </ul>      
      <p>This comprehensive approach ensures that the TIOBE Index provides an accurate snapshot of programming language trends and their global impact.</p>
      <p>Here are the languages we will introduce and compare:</p>
      <ul class="list-2">
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>C++</li>
